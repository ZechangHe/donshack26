# GreenBite

A paperless cafeteria ordering system that eliminates paper waste, cuts wait times, and prevents order theft — built for **DonsHack 2026**.

**Team:** Zechang He & Gabriel Zubovsky
**Theme:** Environment

**Live Demo:** Deployed on [Render](https://render.com) with auto-deploy from GitHub

---

## The Problem

A cafeteria serving 500 students daily wastes over **1,000 sheets of paper** on receipts, order tickets, and queue slips — that's **180,000 sheets per year** from a single cafeteria. Students waste 10–15 minutes in two separate lines (ordering + pickup), orders get stolen, and kitchen staff spend time yelling order numbers instead of preparing food.

## The Solution

GreenBite replaces the entire paper-based cafeteria workflow with a real-time digital system:

- **Students** order from their phone anywhere on campus
- **Kitchen** receives orders instantly on a live dashboard
- **Pickup** is verified with a 6-character code and assigned plate number
- **Zero paper** at every step

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mobile Ordering | Students browse the menu, add to cart, and place orders from anywhere |
| Real-Time Kitchen Dashboard | 3-column Kanban board (Pending → Preparing → Ready) with sound alerts |
| Pickup Code System | 6-character verification code prevents order theft |
| Plate Number Recycling | Slots 1–50 auto-assign and recycle when orders are picked up |
| Live Order Tracking | Students see order status updates in real time via WebSocket |
| Meal Balance | Each student has a deductible balance — like a real campus dining system |
| Impact Tracking | Tracks paper saved, trees preserved, and cost savings per order |
| Confirmation Step | Popup confirmation prevents accidental orders |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)

### Install

```bash

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 5001) concurrently.

### Build & Start (Production)

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Demo Accounts

| Username | Password | Balance |
|----------|----------|---------|
| zechang  | 1234     | $1,000  |
| gabriel  | 1234     | $1,000  |

## How It Works

1. **Student** logs in and browses the menu
2. **Student** adds items to cart and places an order
3. **Kitchen** receives the order instantly via WebSocket
4. **Kitchen** moves order through: Pending → Preparing → Ready
5. **Student** sees live status updates and gets a pickup code + plate number
6. **Student** picks up food — staff verifies the code, marks as picked up
7. **Plate slot** is recycled for the next order

Every order saves 2 sheets of paper. Scale to 500 orders/day = **1,000 sheets saved daily**.
